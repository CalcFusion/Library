We are a start-up company owned and managed by directors that have been in the IT Industry for more than 25 years. Our computation engine was previously a function that we incorporated in our ERP system. This computation engine has since executed millions of computations, and counting, for both SMEs and multi-national companies. Now a stand-alone product, we have allowed communication between CalcFusion and 3rd party systems with a belief that the power of Excel computations can be combined with the power of Cloud and Legacy Systems.
